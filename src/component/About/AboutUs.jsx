       <p>
         I am a full-stack developer with strong experience in both front-end and back-end technologies.
          I work with modern tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js 
          and databases to build complete web applications. Along with professional development, 
          I believe in sharing knowledge with others. That is why I offer free courses in Python and web development. 
          These courses are designed for beginners as well as students who want to improve their skills.
           I explain concepts in a simple and practical way. Learners get hands-on experience through real projects.
            Python is taught from basics to problem-solving and automation.
             Web development covers responsive design and modern frameworks. 
             My goal is to help students build confidence in coding.
              I focus on real-world skills that are useful in the job market. 
              Everyone deserves access to quality education. Through these free courses, I aim to support future developers.
          I also guide students on best coding practices. Learning with me is practical, friendly, and career-focused.
